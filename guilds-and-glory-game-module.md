Section 2 - Module Rules
========================

## 20 Sided Dice

The Guilds and Glory module uses 20 sided dice for dice rolls in place of the usual 12 sided dice.

## Cooperative Gameplay

Most Open Fire games are designed around 2 or more players, each with their own army, competing in a battle to determine who will be the victor. Guilds and Glory is designed around a group of characters, played by one or more players cooperatively, battling against the game itself. To this end the game defines the group of models which are controlled by the players as "characters" and the hostile models controlled by the game as the "enemies".

### Overlord

If you wish, one player may choose to control all of the enemy models in place of a character, rather that having them follow predetermined actions. This adds more depth to the game and potentially increases the challenge for the other players. This player will be called the overlord. If a player is playing as an overlord they should remember that most games are designed such that, if played well and with a bit of luck, the characters will win. The role of overlord is close to the role of a game master in roleplaying games and should be approached as such (though this doesn't mean you must let the players win).

## Rank

Rank is a new attribute for models in Guilds and Glory that represents a models power, skill, and experience on the battlefield. A models rank determines how many abilities a model can have as well as being used as a modifier in many weapons, special rules, and abilities: making a higher rank model more powerful without changing any of their rules.

In addition, when playing in a campaign, player's characters can gain experience and increase their rank, choosing new abilities and benefits, and increasing their effectiveness for the next game.

## Character Abilities

Character abilities are expanded from the core rules into several categories and ranks. When creating characters or increasing their rank they will be limited to abilities from certain categories and those of the same or lesser rank than the character.

## Enemy Abilities

Most enemies have pretedermined abilities and setting their rank determines which of their abilities they can use. This allows you to more easily customise an adventure to suit your needs. Where an enemy model only has a limited number of abilities you may still increase their rank as this may affect other rules within the game but will not allow you to add more abilities.

Section 3 - Creating Characters
===============================

## Determine Starting Attributes

Your character begins with the following attributes:

| Mov | Skl | Def | Cmd | HP  |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 3   | 18  | 18  | 16  | 20  |

You then have 10 points to spend to improve your abilities.

- Improving your Skill, Defence, or Command reduces the value by 1. This costs 1 additional point every time you improve the same attribute, for example the first improvement costs 1 point, the second costs 2 and so on.
- Improving your Movement means increasing the value by 1. This costs a number of points equal to the current value of your Movement.
- Improving your Hit Points means increasing the value by 1 and costs 2 points per improvement.

## Choose Archetype

When creating a character you start by choosing an Archetype which defines your characters main role in the party. Choose from one of the following and gain the listed benefit:

- Warrior: improve either your Skill or Defence by 1.
- Mage: Improve your Command by 1.
- Paladin: Improve your Defence, Command, or Hit Points by 1.
- Rogue: Improve your Movement or Skill by 1.
- Cleric: Improve your Command or Hit Points by 1.

## Choose Aspect

Once you have your Archetype you then select your Aspect. Rather than including long lists of different species your character could be you simply choose the Aspect that you think most applies to them. You should feel free to use whichever Aspect suits your character and ignore traditional fantasy tropes. Choose one of the following:

- Arcane
- Natural
- Shadow
- Light
- Enduring
- Savage
- Construct
- Fey
- Grounded

## Choose Affinity

The last thing to choose is your affinity, this represents a core skillset that your character has. You may only select the affinities allowed by your Archetype or Aspect from the following list:

- Archer
- One-handed
- Two-handed
- Shield
- Stealth
- Poison
- Traps
- Leadership
- Destruction
- Summoning
- Enchanting
