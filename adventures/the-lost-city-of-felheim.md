Introduction
============

The Lost City is a rogue-like adventure for Guilds and Glory for randomised, tile based, dungeon exploration.

## The Fall of Felheim

Felheim was a great city known for it's many mage guilds. Where many other cities restricted and feared magic, the Prince of Felheim was captivated by it's power and potential, patronising the guilds and encouraging their research. While this brought wealth and power to Felheim it also brought danger, accidents were common and so, for a degree of protection, the people and mages dug down creating a labyrinth of tunnels and rooms to house their research in more protected spaces.

As the city delved deeper into the dark, so too did the mages, seeking ever greater power at any cost. No one knows exactly what ultimately destroyed the city but the surface was utterly obliterated, with the destruction burying the under city under so much rock and dirt that it was assumed completely destroyed as well.

Nearly 300 years later a mage at the guild in Hallarn, investigating stones recovered from the area surrounding Felheim deciphered a series of runes that would lead to a startling discovery. These runes were a component in a translocation spell, the other half of which would be inscribed upon a similar series of rocks that would allow someone to instantaneously travel between them. This led to the discovery that deep beneath the blasted ruins of Felheim the undercity still existed and an expedition was led in to explore it.

The undercity is a crumbling ruin, overrun by all sorts of creatures, it's structure is not set, the halls and rooms shift position as the place is steeped in dimensional magic. There are riches beyond measure to be found but not all who seek them ever return.
